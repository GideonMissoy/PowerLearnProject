Difficulties

- Consistency of Data: The dataset contains a variety of incidents with different levels of detail. Some entries provide comprehensive descriptions while others are brief, making it challenging to maintain consistency when summarizing or analyzing the data.
- Geographical Diversity: The incidents span multiple countries, each with different languages and reporting standards. This can lead to variations in the availability and reliability of detailed information.
- Classification of Incidents: The dataset includes various types of stampede incidents (e.g., at sports events, religious gatherings, concerts, etc.), which can complicate efforts to categorize and compare them uniformly.
- Temporal Scope: The dataset covers a period from 2017 to 2021, and the context of events (e.g., local laws, crowd control measures) can change significantly over time, affecting the comparability of incidents.
- Terminology Variations: The use of different terms to describe similar events (e.g., stampede, crush, panic) might pose challenges in ensuring a uniform understanding and analysis of the data.

Interesting Observation

- Recurring Locations: Certain locations, particularly stadiums and religious events, appear multiple times in the dataset as sites of deadly stampedes. This recurrence highlights the importance of effective crowd management in such high-density venues. For instance, stadiums in Antananarivo, Madagascar, and other places are mentioned more than once, suggesting systemic issues in crowd control and safety measures at these sites.
